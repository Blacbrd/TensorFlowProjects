This project folder is a compilation of my projects in tensorflow. So far I have:

* Learnt most of the theory for feedforward neural networks
* This includes: Input vectors, weights and biases (matrix representation), back propegation, gradient descent, multivariable calculus (with chain rule)
* I know the theory of convolutional neural networks, and how they use kernels and max pooling layers for edge/feature detection/recognition, and decreasing the image size respectively.
* How to use Numpy to manipulate the dimensions of arrays (to allow proper dimensions for input layer and matrix multiplication)
* How to use Pandas to read and manipulate CSV files 

Right now I am learning:

* Reinforcement learning, and how agents can be used (may look into robotics)

I make sure to learn all the theory behind every program I write.
